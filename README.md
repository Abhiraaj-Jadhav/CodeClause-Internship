# ðŸ“Œ Task - Fake News Detection
Fake News Detection with Logistic Regression
Overview

Welcome to my Fake News Detection project! In this repository, I've implemented a basic yet effective solution to identify fake news articles using Logistic Regression. Leveraging the Kaggle Fake News Challenge dataset, this project showcases my journey into the realm of data science, focusing on natural language processing and binary classification.
Key Features

    Dataset: Utilized the Kaggle Fake News Challenge dataset, a comprehensive collection of articles labeled as genuine or fake.

    Data Preprocessing: Applied robust cleaning techniques, tokenization, and vectorization to prepare the data for model training.

    Feature Engineering: Extracted relevant features crucial for the Logistic Regression model's training.

    Model Training: Implemented a Logistic Regression model for binary classification, aiming to accurately discern between real and fake news.

Learnings

This project has provided valuable insights and learnings, including:

    Improved understanding of natural language processing techniques.

    Practical experience with logistic regression for binary classification tasks.

    Insight into the challenges associated with fake news detection in real-world scenarios.
